Some files and directories in this folder are only here for documentation:
==========================================================================

The 'source' and 'build' directories are for the sphinx documentation, they are not part of the code.

The make.bat and Makefile are also related to building the sphinx docs.

Source code directories
=======================

The 'factories' directory is for code which is used, for convenience, to generate agents, environments, etc. which are used regularly. It is given its own directory as it is not part of the main implementation.
